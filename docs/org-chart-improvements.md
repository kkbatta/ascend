# Organization Chart Improvements

## Search Functionality Enhancements
**Date: February 19, 2025**

### Key Features
1. **Complete Organizational Context**
   - Shows both upline and downline when searching for a team member
   - Preserves the full hierarchical path from root to the searched member
   - Displays the member's complete team structure below them

2. **Implementation Details**
   ```typescript
   // Key functions:
   findMemberAndPath: Finds a member and builds their path to root
   createFilteredTree: Creates a new tree with both upline and downline
   filterOrgData: Applies designation filters while preserving hierarchy
   ```

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Quick member location through name search
   - Clear visualization of organizational position
   - Maintained designation filtering capabilities
   - Enhanced tree visualization with connecting lines

### Future Considerations
1. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Add path highlighting for the searched member
   - Implement breadcrumb navigation for the current view
   - Add quick navigation to direct reports/team members
   - Enable multi-select for team comparisons

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Consider pagination for large team structures
   - Implement virtual scrolling for better performance
   - Cache frequently accessed organizational structures

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Core search and filter logic
const findMemberAndPath = (
  data: OrgMember,
  searchQuery: string,
  path: OrgMember[] = []
): { member: OrgMember | null; path: OrgMember[] } => {
  const currentPath = [...path, data];
  
  if (data.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())) {
    return { member: data, path: currentPath };
  }

  if (data.children) {
    for (const child of data.children) {
      const result = findMemberAndPath(child, searchQuery, currentPath);
      if (result.member) {
        return result;
      }
    }
  }

  return { member: null, path: [] };
};
```
